AfricTivistes launches its MOOC "Democracy, Elections and Governance in Africa". This premier targets a large audience to provide educational and didactic content on democracy, good governance and elections in Africa. This open and massively accessible distance learning programme on the above-mentioned themes will be an open framework for knowledge building and learning on citizen engagement, participatory democracy, elections, access to information and good governance on the continent and beyond. 

 

This MOOC aims to address the information deficit and difficulties in accessing institutional content on such topics. The courses are provided to the beneficiaries in close conformity with the objectives and principles of the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance (ACDEG) of the African Union). This online training system is structured in five (5) courses. Each course is divided into several modules along with a resource center on various topics which include downloadable documents, video films, infographics, audio files, study reports, scientific publications ...

 

To deliver this rich pedagogical program, AfricTivistes has called upon highly qualified university lecturers, researchers, professionals and experts, and experienced civil society actors who have an undeniable proficiency in the subjects they cover. 

 

The AfricTivistes MOOC DEG will be accessible from March 2022 to March 2024 and targets youth, citizen activists, members of civil society organisations, bloggers, web activists and media professionals. 



**About ACDEG:** 

 

Since the ACDEG came into force in 2012, there has been a significant growth in the African Union's (AU) political and institutional framework for strengthening democracy and good governance. However, there are still various obstacles in AU member states with continued reluctance to domesticate the Charter, which is the main normative instrument of the continent.

 

Faced with such resistance towards the Charter, raising the awareness of African peoples becomes an alternative. The Charter Project Africa has been established to this end. This pan-African project, based on the principles and objectives of the ACDEG, promotes the use of civic tech to amplify the voices of citizens through training, among others. The Charter Project Africa is a consortium of six (6) African and European civil society organisations. 

 

Registration is free and allows prospective learners to commit to the pedagogical and evaluation conditions of the learning programme.
