Civic technology (also called civic tech) enhances the relationship between people and governments with software for communications, decision-making, service delivery, and political processes.  The Charter Project Africa recognises civic tech as the digital tools that make it easier for citizens to organise and mobilise on matters of governance and to engage with decision-makers. 

Our overall objectives include: 

* Supporting civic tech as an amplifier of citizens’ voices and a tool to improve their participation to the governance discussion;
* Empowering civil society to work with the [African Union’s African Governance Architecture (AGA)](https://au.int/en/aga?msclkid=e3beb4d0c56a11ec856134022471b39c) and promote democratic governance in AU member states; 
* Strengthening the ability of civic initiatives to use knowledge, data and technology in their effort to monitor and promote the implementation of the [African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance (ACDEG)](https://au.int/en/treaties/african-charter-democracy-elections-and-governance); 
* Increasing collaboration between AU policymakers, national decision-makers and civil society organisations on matters of democratic governance.

On 30 November 2021 we launched the [CivicTech Fund Africa](https://civictechfund.africa/), a mechanism designed to amplify the work of young African innovators who seek to use technology as a way of enhancing public participation and democratic processes at the local and continental levels. We will achieve this by providing seed grants, technology and data support to successful innovators.

We are therefore delighted to invite you to the unveiling of the first  4 successful teams selected under the grant “[Civic Tech and the African Governance Architecture (AGA)](https://civictechfund.africa/aga/)”. 

The organisations will be empowered to use   civic technology to strengthen citizens’ as well as civil society's engagement with national and continental decision-makers. .
