SIVIO Institute (SI) is an independent organisation focused on ensuring that citizens are at the centre of processes of socio-economic and policy change. It aims to contribute towards Africa’s inclusive socio-economic transformation. It is borne out of a desire to enhance agency as a stimulus/catalyst for inclusive political and socio-economic transformation.

SIVIO Institute’s civic tech initiative aims at enhancing government effectiveness and accountability by leveraging technology to track the conversion of electoral promises into policy actions. We seek to enhance public discussion and evidence-based advocacy for improved performance by governments in Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
