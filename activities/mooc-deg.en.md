The MOOC "Democracy and Governance in Africa" aims to overcome the information deficit, the difficulties of access to institutional content and the bias of the media. Thus, the programme targets young people, civil society actors, media actors and professionals, public administration officials (central or local).

The objective of the distance learning programme is to provide pedagogical and didactic content on democracy, good governance and elections in Africa. It is a response to a growing demand for mastery of the concepts involved.

The "Democracy, Elections and Governance in Africa" distance learning programme is implemented by AfricTivistes as part of the Charter Project Africa. These online courses are delivered to beneficiaries in close alignment with the objectives of the ACDEG and the Charter Project Africa.
